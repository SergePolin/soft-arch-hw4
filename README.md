## How We Designed It

### Iteration 1: Structuring the System

We broke down the system into core modules to keep things organized:

- **User Interface Module**: Manages what users see and how they interact with the platform.
- **Communication Module**: Handles video and audio calls using WebRTC, managing both direct connections and group calls through media servers.
- **Security Module**: Keeps everything secure with authentication, encryption, and authorization.
- **Collaboration Module**: Manages the shared whiteboard and file sharing, ensuring changes appear in real-time for everyone.
- **Data Management Module**: Uses MongoDB to store everything from user profiles to session logs.
- **Integration Module**: Makes sure the platform works smoothly with other services like cloud storage and email.

This setup makes each part of the system easy to manage and scale.

### Iteration 2: Making Calls Work Smoothly

Here’s how a video call works:

1. **Start a Call**: User A initiates a call, and the system sets up a connection with User B.
2. **Set Up Connection**: Using WebRTC, the system establishes a direct peer-to-peer link.
3. **Stream Media**: Audio and video streams are exchanged directly, keeping the delay low.
4. **Collaborate on the Whiteboard**: During the call, users can share ideas on a whiteboard, with real-time updates.
5. **End the Call**: The system ends the connection when the call is over, freeing up resources.

This approach keeps the communication fast and responsive.

### Iteration 3: Scaling Up

Our deployment setup ensures that the platform can grow with user demand:

- **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic evenly across web servers, preventing overload.
- **Web Servers**: Automatically scale up when more users join.
- **Media Servers**: Manage video streams for large group calls.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Allows us to scale individual services like user management without affecting others.
- **Database Cluster**: Uses MongoDB sharding to handle large amounts of data.
- **Security Services**: Ensures encryption and manages user access.
- **External Integrations**: Connects with cloud storage and email providers.

This setup makes sure that the platform stays fast and efficient as it grows.

### Iteration 4: Keeping It Secure

Here’s how we keep data safe:

1. **User Login**: Manages login and multi-factor authentication.
2. **Permission Management**: Controls what each user can access.
3. **Data Encryption**: Keeps everything secure during communication.
4. **Audit Logging**: Tracks user actions for compliance.
5. **Compliance Management**: Makes sure the system follows GDPR and other regulations.
6. **Key Management**: Secures encryption keys to prevent unauthorized access.

These components ensure that the platform stays secure and meets privacy laws.

### Iteration 5: Making It Easy to Use

We designed the user experience to be as simple as possible:

1. **Login**: Users sign in with their credentials.
2. **Dashboard**: A central hub where users can start calls, access files, and see what’s new.
3. **Collaboration Area**: Use the whiteboard or work on shared documents with teammates.
4. **Device Setup**: Easily configure webcams, microphones, and other devices.
5. **Settings**: Adjust preferences and manage profiles.

This setup makes sure users can focus on their work without getting lost in the interface.

## Evaluating the Design

### Key Scenarios
