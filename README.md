# Designing an Internet-Based Collaboration System

## Introduction

We're creating an Internet-based collaboration platform aimed at enhancing global teamwork among remote teams. This system is especially beneficial for groups working on complex projects, like software development, that require frequent communication and coordination. The platform will include a range of tools—video calls, chat, email, file sharing, and a shared whiteboard for brainstorming and sketching out ideas, like UML diagrams. It is designed to make remote work feel as close as possible to in-person collaboration.

## Project Overview

The collaboration system is part of a growing market of tools that support remote teamwork. It needs to integrate well with existing solutions like Slack, Teams, and Trello to be effective in various professional environments. Our goal is to ensure the system is scalable, secure, and user-friendly, making it suitable for teams across different industries and geographical locations.

## Design Process Using ADD

### Iteration 1: Laying Out the Core Structure

**Diagram Description**: The High-Level Module Diagram shows the system’s main parts—User Interface, Communication, Security, Collaboration, Data Management, and Integration Modules—illustrating how each module plays a specific role:

- **User Interface Module**: Handles user interactions, ensuring responsiveness and a seamless experience across devices.
- **Communication Module**: Manages real-time communication with WebRTC, supporting both direct peer-to-peer connections and server-assisted group calls.
- **Security Module**: Manages authentication, authorization, and encryption, keeping user data secure.
- **Collaboration Module**: Handles shared whiteboards, file sharing, and document editing, ensuring real-time updates.
- **Data Management Module**: Uses MongoDB for storing user profiles, logs, and collaboration data.
- **Integration Module**: Connects to third-party tools like email services and cloud storage, making the platform versatile.

### Iteration 2: Focus on Real-time Communication

**Diagram Description**: The Sequence Diagram illustrates how a video call is initiated and managed between users:

- **Call Initiation**: User A starts a call, and the system sets up the connection using WebRTC, establishing a peer-to-peer link with User B.
- **Media Exchange**: Audio and video streams are shared directly between users, minimizing delays.
- **Whiteboard Interaction**: Users can collaborate using the whiteboard feature during the call, with updates transmitted in real time.
- **End Call**: When the call ends, the system releases resources and closes the connection.

### Iteration 3: Making Sure It Scales

**Diagram Description**: The Deployment Diagram maps out how different components are distributed across servers and cloud services:

- **Client Devices**: Users access the platform through web or mobile apps.
- **Load Balancer (ELB)**: Distributes traffic across web servers to avoid overloading.
- **Web Servers**: Serve the frontend, automatically scaling up to handle increased user traffic.
- **Media Servers**: Manage video streams for large group calls.
- **Application Logic**: Divided into microservices, handling tasks like user management and collaboration tools.
- **Database Cluster**: Uses MongoDB sharding for efficient data management.
- **Security Services**: Ensures secure user sessions and data encryption.
- **External Services**: Manages integrations with cloud storage and email providers.

### Iteration 4: Implement Security and Compliance

**Diagram Description**: The Security Component Diagram outlines the services that keep user data safe:

- **Authentication Service**: Manages user login.
- **Authorization Service**: Determines user access based on roles.
- **Encryption Service**: Secures data in transit and at rest.
- **Audit Logging**: Keeps records of user actions for compliance.
- **Compliance Service**: Manages legal requirements like data retention.
- **Key Management**: Handles encryption keys to ensure data security.

### Iteration 5: Making It User-Friendly

**Diagram Description**: The High-Level UI Flow Diagram shows the user’s journey through the platform:

- **Login**: Users enter their credentials to access the system.
- **Dashboard**: A central hub for starting calls, accessing files, and viewing activity.
- **Collaboration Area**: Includes tools like the whiteboard for real-time teamwork.
- **Device Setup**: Handles configuration of webcams and other input devices.
- **Settings**: Allows users to manage preferences and profiles.

## Evaluating the Design with ATAM

### Scenario Evaluations

- **Handling Heavy Usage**: The system keeps response time below 100ms even during peak usage.
- **Reconnecting After Network Issues**: If a user disconnects, the system automatically retries connection.
- **Keeping Data Secure**: All communication is encrypted, and access is controlled through secure authentication.
- **Scaling to Meet Demand**: The system can automatically scale up server resources to handle more users.
- **Compliance**: Logs user actions and data handling to meet GDPR and HIPAA requirements.

### Trade-offs

- **Performance vs. Complexity**: Using WebRTC is fast but requires more setup.
- **Scalability vs. Cost**: Auto-scaling ensures smooth performance but increases costs during peak periods.

## Wrapping Up

The design of this collaboration platform balances the needs for scalability, security, and ease of use. By following the ADD method and evaluating key scenarios with ATAM, we’ve created a robust system that supports seamless communication and collaboration, helping remote teams work together effectively.
